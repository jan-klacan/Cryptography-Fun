README FOR "Vigenere_Cipher_Encrypt_Decrypt.py"

The purpose of my script is a simple Python implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher technique. I implemented an interface for the user of the script so that when run, the user is presented with choices with the ultimate purpose of executing one of the two below:
1. Encrypt a message with a user-specified keyword
2. Decrypt a message with a user-specified keyword

The code is built on 4 functions: 
- a helper function to slice the characters of the keyword into a list
- a function for encryption
- a function for decryption
- a function for the main running interface with input handling so that the user's choices are constrained to predetermined ranges

Just run and enjoy.
