README FOR "01_Caesar_Cipher_Encrypt_Decrypt_BruteForce.py"

The purpose of my script is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar cipher technique. I implemented an interface for the user of the script so that when run, the user is presented with choices with the ultimate purpose of executing one of the three below:
1. Encrypt a message with a user-specified shift value
2. Decrypt a message with a user-specified shift value
3. Execute brute force attack on a decrypted message (no shift value specified)
(Note: in the code, I call the shift value "shift-by".)

The code is built on 3 functions - one for encryption, one for decryption, and one for the main running interface with input handling so that the user's choices are constrained to predetermined ranges. The brute force attack is built into the main running interface function.

Just run and enjoy.
